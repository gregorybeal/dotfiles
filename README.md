# dotfiles

Personal config for shell, tmux, git, SSH, terminals, and VS Code. Managed with [GNU Stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/). Works on Mac, Linux, and WSL. (Native Windows is no longer supported — use WSL.)

## Quick start

**On a brand new machine (Mac or WSL/Linux):**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/gregorybeal/dotfiles ~/dotfiles
cd ~/dotfiles
./bootstrap.sh
```

After bootstrap, restart your shell and run:
```bash
gh auth login        # GitHub HTTPS auth — yes to "authenticate git"
make doctor           # verify everything's healthy
```

## Daily commands

```bash
make help          # show all targets
make stow           # (re-)symlink all packages into $HOME — idempotent
make unstow          # remove all package symlinks from $HOME
make update         # git pull + re-stow
make doctor          # health check
make setup-local    # (re-)create machine-local config (git identity, jira-cli config)
make brew           # install/update from mac/Brewfile (Mac) or linux/Brewfile (Linux/WSL)
make wt             # WSL: merge windows-terminal/settings.json into Windows Terminal
```

**Edit a config file directly** (it's just a symlink back into this repo):
```bash
$EDITOR ~/.tmux.conf   # or ~/.gitconfig, ~/.config/starship.toml, etc.
                        # editing the symlink target edits the file in this repo directly
```

## How it works

Each top-level directory is a **Stow package** whose contents mirror `$HOME`. `stow <package>` (run from this directory) symlinks everything inside `<package>/` into the matching path under `$HOME`. For example, `git/.gitconfig` becomes a symlink at `~/.gitconfig`. Everything you see under `~/.config/...` (or `~/.zshrc`, `~/.gitconfig`, etc.) for a stowed tool is a symlink pointing back into this repo — edit it in place, `git commit`, done.

**zsh deliberately isn't under `~/.config/zsh`:** zsh reads exactly one `.zshenv` automatically, resolved via `$ZDOTDIR`-or-`$HOME` *before* that resolution can be redirected — so pointing `ZDOTDIR` at `~/.config/zsh` from within `~/.zshenv` doesn't make zsh go back and re-read a second `.zshenv` from there; it silently never runs. Rather than work around that, `~/.zshenv` and `~/.zshrc` just live where zsh already looks for them by default, same as every other tool in this repo. The supporting files (`plugins.zsh`, `bindings.zsh`, etc.) live in a plain `~/.zsh/` and are `source`d explicitly from `.zshrc`.

**Adopting an existing machine:** Stow refuses to symlink over a real (non-symlink) file that's already there — and it's all-or-nothing per invocation, so *one* conflict (e.g. Ubuntu's default `~/.bashrc`, or a `~/.config/ghostty/config` you set up before adopting this repo) blocks *every* package, not just the conflicting one. `make stow` runs `scripts/adopt-conflicts.sh` first, which detects exactly that case and moves the conflicting real files to `~/.dotfiles-backup/<timestamp>/` (never deletes) before stowing — so `make stow` / `./bootstrap.sh` works the same whether the machine is brand new or already has its own dotfiles.

Adding a new package: create a directory named after the tool, lay out files inside it exactly as they should appear relative to `$HOME` (e.g. `mytool/.config/mytool/config`), then add it to `CORE_PACKAGES` (or `MAC_PACKAGES` for Mac-only tools) in the `Makefile` and run `make stow`.

**Directories Stow doesn't create:** Stow creates whatever directory structure is needed to host the files it's symlinking (e.g. `~/.config/atuin/` gets created automatically because `config.toml` lives there) — but it has no reason to create directories that don't contain a stowed file. A few tools need such directories at runtime for cache/state/sockets they generate themselves (zsh's history file and completion dump, SSH's control sockets). `make dirs` creates those; `make stow` depends on it, so a plain `make stow` (or `./bootstrap.sh`) always covers it. If you ever see zsh history not persisting or SSH connection-sharing not kicking in, run `make dirs` (or check `make doctor`, which verifies all of them exist).

The register tooling (fzf pickers `fssh`/`fvnc`/`frtsx`/…, the Alfred workflows,
and the Royal TSX dynamic folder) all share one inventory: the ssh config block
generated by `scripts/gen_ssh_registers.py`, decorated from the inventory
database. The shell side lives in `zsh/.zsh/local-tools.zsh`.

## WSL (Windows Terminal + Ubuntu)

Same repo, same `./bootstrap.sh` — everything WSL-specific is gated on `$WSL_DISTRO_NAME`, so nothing here changes the Mac.

- **Packages:** `linux/packages.sh` installs a small apt base (zsh, stow, sshfs, mtr, socat, wslu), then `linux/Brewfile` through Linuxbrew so tool versions match the Mac. `.zshenv`/`.bashrc` load Linuxbrew from `/home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew` (or `~/.linuxbrew`).
- **SSH keys from 1Password on Windows:** `zsh/.zsh/ssh-agent.zsh` runs `socat` on `~/.1password/agent.sock` and hands each connection to `npiperelay.exe`, which talks to 1Password's `openssh-ssh-agent` pipe. Windows-side setup, once:
  1. 1Password → Settings → Developer → **Use the SSH agent**
  2. `winget install albertony.npiperelay` (`packages.sh` does this for you), then restart Windows Terminal so the new PATH reaches WSL
  3. If the Windows **OpenSSH Authentication Agent** service is running, stop and disable it — it claims the same pipe

  Without `npiperelay.exe` it falls back to a local `ssh-agent` with key files, same as plain Linux.
- **Clipboard:** tmux copy-mode, nvim (`unnamedplus`) and the `pbcopy`/`pbpaste` aliases use `win32yank.exe` (`winget install equalsraf.win32yank`) — `clip.exe` works but mangles non-ASCII. OSC 52 also works, since Windows Terminal supports it.
- **Opening things:** `$BROWSER` and an `open` alias point at `wslview` (or `explorer.exe`), so `gh auth login`, tmux-fzf-url, `open .` all land in Windows.
- **Windows Terminal:** `windows-terminal/settings.json` holds only what's managed — Catppuccin Mocha scheme/theme (matching tmux + Ghostty), FiraCode Nerd Font, copy-on-select, and unbinding the keys WT would otherwise steal from tmux/nvim/zsh (`ctrl+v` → nvim block-visual, `alt+arrows`, `alt+shift+arrows`; paste is `ctrl+shift+v`). `make wt` merges it into the live settings (profiles, GUIDs and anything else you set in the UI are kept; the old file is backed up next to it), makes this distro the default profile, and starts it in `~`. `make wt DRY=1` shows the diff first. Install **FiraCode Nerd Font** on Windows — `make wt` warns if it's missing.

## Machine-specific / secret files (never committed, gitignored)

- `~/.gitconfig.local` — **required**: `[user] name / email / signingkey`. Created by `make setup-local` (prompts on first run).
- `~/.zshrc.local` — extra zsh config (work credentials, machine-specific PATH, etc.)
- `~/.bashrc.local` — extra bash config
- `~/.ssh/config.local` — extra SSH config, included automatically
- `~/.secrets` — env vars / tokens (sourced by both zsh + bash)

## tmux keybindings

The **prefix is `` ` ``** (backtick, remapped from `C-b`). Press it twice to type a literal backtick. Sessions auto-save and restore across reboots (resurrect + continuum), and the left of the status bar shows a `PREFIX` / `COPY` / `Sync` indicator when those modes are active.
